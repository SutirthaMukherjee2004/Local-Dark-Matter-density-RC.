cuts we adopted: 
____________________________________________
15<l<345..else beyond this limit the vc-s are negative..towards GC nebo na..radila velo are expectde to be zero..so randomness er effect is large..
bulge avoided since data is 3 kpc onwards and b is lt 10 degrees..hence also halo avoided as well
abs(b)<10 as mentioned by Philip 2001 ppr(A&A 367, 967{972 (2001))
peculiar velo cut not possible it requires a preknown RC data..so we assume all v_r contributed by rotation velo only..

(i) We have included only galactic disk planetary nebulae, so that
halo (type IV) and bulge (type V) nebulae have been
excluded. (|b|<15 ** see phillips2011 sec 3)

(ii) PN having extremely large peculiar radial
velocities have not been considered, as these objects
have a weak correlation with the galactic disk
rotation curve, as can be seen for example by the
work of Maciel & Dutra (1992). These objects are
basically Peimbert type III nebulae, so that most
of the objects in our sample could be classified as
type I or II, and our curves can be directly compared
with the corresponding results by Maciel &
Dutra (1992).

(iii) objects near the direction
of the galactic center have been excluded, since the
expected radial velocities of these objects may show
a very large variation, so that the possible errors
are increased. Therefore, our sample does not include
objects having galactic longitudes within 20
degrees of the galactic center. (0<l<10,350>l>360 ** see phillips2011 sec 3)

(iv) in order to make a homogeneous comparison of the four
distance scales, we have considered objects in the
galactocentric range of approximately 4 to 14 kpc.
Applying these selection criteria, our final samples
include 259 objects for the distance scale by Maciel
(1984)

**Fig. 1 shows all objects in the approximate range of 
4 to 14 kpc with measured radial velocities adopting distances of Maciel
(1984), including limits. If we exclude those nebulae
for which distance limits are given in Maciel
(1984), the number of objects drops to about two
hundred nebulae, but the behavior of the rotation
curve is indistinguishable from Fig. 1, so that we prefer
to display the full statistical sample.

(a) Sources are excluded if they possess galactic latitudes
0 < l < 10 and 350 < l < 360; thereby eliminating
the large majority of population II PN (bulge sources)
which do not follow the disk rotation curve;

b) We also exclude sources having 90 < l < 270, since
the galactic rotation curve is relatively ill-defined for
radii R > R0 (see for instance Honma & Sofue 1997);

c) We only include nebulae possessing galactic latitudes
|b| < 15, in order to restrict the sample to those
sources which are clearly participating in disk rotation.
In fact, of the sample to be analysed later, fully
90% have latitudes |b|< 10;

d) Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we select
ranges of l and Vr over which non-linearities in the
distance scale are likely to be small. In particular, we
eliminate sources having Vr < VA = 40 kms−1, and
which have velocities within 40 km s−1 of the maximum
(tangential) rotational velocity along any particular
longitude l. Specifically:
Vr .le. VB = \theta(R = R0 sin(l)) − \theta_0 sin(l) − 40 kms−1:
Assuming to a first approximation that \theta(R) ~ \theta(R0) = 220 kms−1, this then yields
Vr < (180 − 220 sin(l)) kms−1;
suggesting that l < 40 where Vr > 40 kms−1. Given the
constraint cited in (a) above, this then implies that only
sources having 10 < l < 40, and 320 < l < 350 are
appropriate for inclusion in this analysis.
